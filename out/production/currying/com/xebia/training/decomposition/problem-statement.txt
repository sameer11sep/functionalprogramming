Design a system that parses an expression. An expression contains an operator and two operands or it could simply be a value which would be
a Number.

e.g  5 + 4 - is an expression that represents Sum of two numbers


System may be required to either print or evaluate the expressions.

eval(5+4) = 9

and show(5+4) = "5 + 4"

Operations would be Sum, Product etc

Design the class hierarchies
